**Nominal rate / Quoted Rate / Stated Rate / Annual Interest Rate**: Denote by $i^{(m)}$. If $m$ is number of interest periods per year, $i$ is interest rate per interest period,
$$
i = \frac{i^{(m)}}{m}
$$

This gives, if n is number of interest periods, assuming Simple Interest
$$
P_n = P_0(1 + ni)
$$
