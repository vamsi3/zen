## Theory

### Floyd's algorithm
Floyd's algorithm (also called tortoise and hare algorithm) only accesses the sequence by storing and copying pointers, function evaluations, and equality tests; therefore, it qualifies as a pointer algorithm. It uses $O(λ + μ)$ operations of these types, and $O(1)$ storage space.

### Brent's algorithm
Brent's algorithm is also a pointer algorithm that uses $O(λ + μ)$ tests and function evaluations and $O(1)$ storage space. It has two advantages compared to the Floyd's algorithm: it finds the correct length $λ$ of the cycle directly, rather than needing to search for it in a subsequent stage, and its steps involve only one evaluation of $f$ rather than three. The number of function evaluations can never be higher than for Floyd's algorithm. Brent claims that, on average, his cycle finding algorithm runs around $36\%$ more quickly than Floyd's and that it speeds up the Pollard's rho algorithm by around $24\%$.

## Code

```cpp
#include <functional>

namespace CycleDetection {
    std::tuple<int, int> floyd(int start, std::function<int (int)> f) {
        int a = f(start), b = f(a);
        while (a != b) { a = f(a); b = f(f(b)); }

        int mu = 0;
        a = start;
        while (a != b) { a = f(a); b = f(b); ++mu; }

        int lambda = 0;
        do { b = f(b); ++lambda; } while (a != b);

        return {lambda, mu};
    }

    std::tuple<int, int> brent(int start, std::function<int (int)> f) {
        int lambda = 1, power = 1;
        int a = start, b = f(a);
        while (a != b) {
            if (lambda == power) { a = b; power *= 2; lambda = 0; }
            b = f(b); ++lambda;
        }

        a = b = start;
        for (int i = 0; i < lambda; ++i) b = f(b);

        int mu = 0;
        while (a != b) { a = f(a); b = f(b); ++mu; }

        return {lambda, mu};
    }
}

#include <iostream>

int f(int x) {
    if (x == 10) return 3;
    return x + 1;
}

int main() {
    auto [x, y] = CycleDetection::brent(0, f);
    std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n';
}
